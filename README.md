# VOID - Hyper-Intelligent Virtual Environment Manager

`VOID` is a powerful tool designed to manage and optimize quantum virtual environments. It facilitates seamless project management, dependency resolution, and performance alignment within a virtual environment. With its intuitive commands, VOID simplifies the process of managing quantum development projects and enhances the stability of your virtual environments.

## Features
- **Sanctum Creation**: Create Sanctums with a shared `qvenv` to manage multiple projects.
- **Project Installation**: Clone and install projects directly into your Sanctum.
- **Dependency Management**: Resolve conflicts, upgrade dependencies, and merge shared dependencies seamlessly.
- **Quantum Scan**: Perform a quantum scan for errors and analyze potential issues within your projects.
- **Performance Alignment**: Optimize your `qvenv` performance and analyze dependencies for improvements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/subatomicERROR/Void.git
    cd Void
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Make sure your environment is set up correctly:
    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ```

4. Create a virtual environment if not already set up:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv qvenv
    ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source qvenv/bin/activate
    ```
